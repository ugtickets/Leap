									<br><br>
									<b>5.1.3 Book Rejection.</b> We are entitled to determine what content we accept and distribute through the Program in our sole discretion.

You authorize us, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider appropriate to verify your rights to permit our distribution of the Books and the accuracy of the information or documentation you provide to us with respect to those rights. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.1.4 Book Withdrawal.</b> You may withdraw your digital books and/or audiobooks from further sale in the Program at any time on five business days advance notice by following the then current Program procedures for Book withdrawal or unpublishing. We may fulfill any customer orders completed through the date the Books are available for sale.

									<br><br>
									<b>5.1.5 Reformatting.</b> We may, in our discretion, reformat your Books, and you acknowledge that unintentional errors may occur in the process of reformatting of your Books. If any such errors do occur, you may remove the affected Book from further sale in the Program as provided in Section 5.1.4 above, and this will be your only remedy for the errors. We may also, in our discretion, correct any errors existing in a Book file as you deliver it to us. Currently AfricanBooks.com uses .epub, .pdf and .mp3 file formats, with other formats being added on an as-needed basis. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.1.6 Exclusivity.</b> At this time, AfricanBooks.com does not demand exclusive rights to sell and distribute your Digital Book in digital format.

									<br><br>
									<b>5.2 Marketing and Promotion, Reviews, Sharing eBooks, Pre-orders & Sales</b>
									<br><br>
									<b>5.2.1 Marketing and Promotion.</b> We will have sole discretion in determining all marketing and promotions related to the sale of your Books through the Program and may, without limitation, market and promote your Books by making chapters, quotes, or portions of your Books available to prospective customers without charge, and by permitting prospective customers to see excerpts of your Books in response to search queries. We will not owe you any fees for any marketing or promotional efforts. You acknowledge that we have no obligation to market, distribute, or offer for sale any Book, or to continuing marketing, distributing or selling a Book after we have commenced doing so. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.2.2 Reviews.</b> You are subject to the same guidelines as any other customer contributing a review to an AfricanBooks.com website.  We reserve the right to remove any review that violates our community guidelines, denoted in section 11. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.2.3 Sharing Books.</b> AfricanBooks.com strictly prohibits the copying or sharing of Books (eBooks, audioBooks, etc). AfricanBooks.com uses strict protocols to protect the copyrighted content of your Books. In the event of unlawful distribution of Books / Digital content by its users, authors or publishers, the AfricanBooks.com platform will not be held liable. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.2.4 Promotional Pricing/Sales Programs.</b> AfricanBooks.com allows authors/publishers to offer your Digital Book in a promotional offer or sale promotion once per quarter, with a maximum promotion window of 2 weeks. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.2.4 (a)</b> If you are compliant with this Agreement, for each Digital Book sold to a customer through a promotional price or sales window, AfricanBooks.com will pay you a Royalty based on the “Promotional List Price” that you provide, as described in our Digital Pricing Policy, net of refunds, bad debt, and any VAT, sales or other taxes charged to a customer or applied with respect to sales to a customer.  As with any List Price, to the extent not prohibited by applicable local laws, we have the discretion to set the retail customer price at which your Digital Books are sold.  
									<br><br>
									<b>5.2.4 (b)</b> Free Promotions. You can schedule one or more free promotions for your Digital Book for up to a total period of 5 days only once per annum. A free promotion is the offering of your Digital Book to customers for a price of zero. You will not receive any Royalties on your Digital Book during a free promotion. If you don’t use all 5 free promotion days during the year, you can’t roll them over to future periods. Scheduled start times and end times of free promotions are approximate due to potential system latencies. Any costs incurred by AfricanBooks.com as part of the free offering may be deducted from other royalties you have collected within your Program account and withheld on your next royalty distribution payment.
									<br><br>
									<b>5.2.5 Book Pre-Orders.</b> You may make an eligible Digital Book that meets pre-order requirements available for customer pre-order up to 60 days in advance of that Digital Book’s official release date. You may make your eligible Digital Book available for pre-order by choosing “pre-order” as your book release option during title set-up.  We have established important deadlines for pre-order enrollment to ensure a positive customer experience.  If you miss these deadlines, we may suspend your access to pre-order and customer pre-orders may be cancelled. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.2.5 (a)</b> Pre-Order Publisher Payments.  Royalties for pre-order sales will be paid approximately 60 days following the end of the calendar month of the Digital Book’s actual release date. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.2.5 (b)</b> Pre-Order Price Guarantee.  AfricanBooks.com offers customers a Pre-order Price Guarantee for pre-orders on our website that guarantees that a customer is charged the lowest price offered by AfricanBooks.com between the time the customer places the order and the end of the day of the release date. As a result, if you lower the List Price of a Digital Book while it is available for pre-order, we may charge customers that pre-ordered that Digital Book before the price decrease the lower price.  Your Royalty will be based on the actual price we charge customers as a result of our Pre-order Price Guarantee, net of refunds, bad debt, and any VAT, sales or other taxes charged to a customer or applied with respect to sales to a customer. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.2.6</b> AfricanBooks.com may at times offer readers a free book with cumulative purchases over a specific dollar amount as specified on AfricanBooks.com. In circumstances where your book is selected for a free-book promotion, you will not receive any Royalties on your Digital Book during a free promotion neither will AfricanBooks.com withhold any costs incurred by us from your publishing account.
									<br><br>
									<b>5.3 Pricing.</b> 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.3.1 Providing Your List Price.</b> The list price you provide to us is referred to in this Agreement as your "List Price." For some marketplaces, you will provide us a List Price inclusive of value added or similar taxes that are included within the customer purchase price of a product (“VAT”).  Where your Royalty is calculated based on your List Price, it will be calculated based on your List Price exclusive of the VAT applicable to the customer.  You may change your List Price through the Author/Publisher’s platform, and your change will be effective within 5 business days. You must comply with all requirements outlined in our digital pricing policy. The List Price for purposes of the Royalty calculation will be the List Price we determine to be effective at the time of customer purchase.
									<br><br>
									<b>5.3.2 Currency Conversion.</b> We may sell your Book using multiple currencies. When we do, we may convert the List Price you submit to other currencies (each, a "Sale Currency") at an exchange rate we determine. We may periodically update the converted List Price in order to reflect current exchange rates. If the converted List Price would be outside of the minimum or maximum List Price we accept for the Sale Currency, your List Price will be converted so that it is equal to the applicable minimum or maximum List Price for that Sale Currency. Minimum and maximum List Prices are specified within our digital pricing policy. For purposes of royalty calculations, the converted List Price in the Sale Currency will be your List Price when we offer and sell your Book in the Sale Currency. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.3.3 Multiple List Prices.</b> We may give you the option to provide multiple List Prices for a Book in different currencies. If you provide multiple List Prices for a Book, where we sell your Book to customers in a particular country from more than another, we may use one of those List Prices for sales to customers in that country on all of our websites, to provide consistency across those sites. For example, if you provide us with a Ugandan Shillings List Price and a US Dollar List Price for a Book, we may use the Ugandan Shillings List Price for all sales to Ugandan customers no matter where they are physically located and we may convert it as provided in 5.3.2 above. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.3.4 Customer Prices.</b> To the extent not prohibited by applicable laws, we have sole and complete discretion to set the retail customer price at which your Books are sold through the Program. We are solely responsible for the payment platforms and payment providers we use to maintain the operations of our business, this includes the processing payments, payment collection and related customer service.  
									<br><br>
									<b>5.4 Royalties and Payments.</b>
									<br><br>
									<b>5.4.1 Royalties.</b> If you are not in breach of your obligations under this Agreement, for each Book sold to a customer through the Program, AfricanBooks.com, being the party that made the sale (or whose affiliate made the sale), will pay you the applicable Royalty set forth in our digital pricing policy as applicable, net of refunds, bad debt, and any VAT, sales or other taxes charged to a customer or applied with respect to sales to a customer. If your List Price for a Book is higher than permitted under our pricing policy as applicable, we will be entitled to deem it modified so that it is equal to the maximum List Price permitted when calculating Royalties due to you under this Agreement. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.4.2 When We Pay You.</b> Unless otherwise specified our digital pricing policy, AfricanBooks.com or our country-specific partners, will pay Royalties due on Book sales within at least 30 days following the end of the calendar month during which the sales were made. At the time of payment, we will make available to you an online report detailing sales of Books and corresponding Royalties. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.4.3 Payment Currencies.</b> If you change your payment currency, the change will be effective on the first day of the following calendar month (unless we make an earlier period available). If we pay you in a currency other than the Sale Currency, we will convert the Royalties due from the Sale Currency to the payment currency at an exchange rate we determine, which will be inclusive of all fees and charges for the conversion. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.4.4 Payment Terms for Publishers.</b>  If you are a publisher, you must provide us with a legally binding author/publishers agreement stating your right to distribute the author’s content and collect royalties from it.  We will pay you Royalties based on the publisher’s digital pricing and also distribute royalties to the book author on your behalf. All publishers are required to submit their company incorporation documents and tax identification numbers in accordance with your country’s business/tax requirements.
									<br><br>
									<b>5.4.5 Payments Methods.</b> Royalties are paid directly to authors and/or publishers banking institutions or selected mobile money accounts. All banking/mobile money accounts should reflect the registered author/publishers legal name for payments to be processed by AfricanBooks.com.
									<br><br>
									<b>5.4.6 Payment Policies.</b> We may require you to provide certain tax and/or other legal identification information to register a valid bank account in your AfricanBooks.com account in order to receive Royalty payments, in which case we will not be obligated to make Royalty payments to you unless you do so. We may establish other payment policies from time to time, such as minimum payment amounts for different payment methods and transfer payment fees.
									<br><br>
									<b>5.4.7 Payment Disputes.</b> You may not bring a suit or other legal proceeding against AfricanBooks.com with regard to any statement unless you bring it within three months after the date the statement is available. Any such proceeding will be limited to a determination of the amount of monies, if any, payable by us to you for the accounting periods in question, and your sole remedy will be the recovery of those monies with no interest. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.4.8 Offsets, etc.</b> We can withhold Royalties and offset them against future payments as indicated below. Our exercise of these rights does not limit other rights we may have to withhold or offset Royalties or exercise other remedies. 
									<br><br>
									<i class="tc-point"></i>If we pay you a Royalty on a sale and later issue a refund or credit for that sale, we may offset the amount of the Royalty previously paid for the sale against future Royalties, or require you to remit that amount to us. 
									<br>
									<i class="tc-point"></i>If a third party asserts that you did not have all rights required to make one of your Books available through the Program, we may hold all Royalties due to you until we reasonably determine the validity of the third-party claim. If we determine that you did not have all of those rights or that you have otherwise breached your representations and warranties or our content guidelines with regard to a Book, we will not owe you Royalties for that Book and we may offset any of those Royalties that were previously paid against future Royalties, or require you to remit them to us.<br>
									<i class="tc-point"></i>Upon termination of this Agreement, we may withhold all Royalties due for a period of three months from the date they would otherwise be payable in order to ensure our ability to off-set any refunds or other offsets we are entitled to take against the Royalties.<br>								
									<i class="tc-point"></i>If we terminate this Agreement because you have breached your representations and warranties or our content guidelines, you forfeit all Royalties not yet paid to you. If after we have terminated your account you open a new account without our express permission, we will not owe you any Royalties through the new account. <br>
									<i class="tc-point"></i>If we determine in our sole discretion that deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity has occurred with respect to your Books or your Program account, then we may permanently withhold payments to you, and we may offset any payments previously paid against future payments or require you to remit them to us. We will use these funds to offset the costs of AfricanBooks.com’s enforcement efforts and/or to compensate third parties harmed by deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal conduct. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.4.9 Taxes.</b> AfricanBooks.com (or their affiliates) are responsible for reporting, collecting and remitting any and all government mandated taxes imposed on their respective sales earnings from Books sold to customers through our publishing platform as outlined by your country of residence. As an author or publisher on our platform, you are responsible for any personal or business income taxes or other taxes due resulting from royalty payments submitted to you by AfricanBooks.com or our partners under this Agreement. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, the amounts due to you hereunder are inclusive of any taxes that may apply to such payments. AfricanBooks.com maintains the right, however, to report, deduct and/or withhold any and all applicable taxes from amounts due by them to you, and the amounts due, as reduced by those deductions or withholdings, will constitute full payment and settlement to you. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.5 Grant of Rights.</b> You grant to AfricanBooks.com and our partners, throughout the term of this Agreement, a nonexclusive, irrevocable, right and license to distribute Books, directly and through third-party distributors, in all formats you choose to make available through ABC by all distribution means available. This right includes, without limitation, the right to: (a) reproduce, index and store Books on one or more computer facilities, and reformat, convert and encode Books; (b) display, market, transmit, distribute, sell, license and otherwise make available all or any portion of Books through AfricanBooks.com Properties (as defined below), for customers and prospective customers to download, access, copy and paste, print, annotate and/or view online and offline, including on portable devices; (c) permit customers to "store" Digital Books that they have purchased from us on servers ("Virtual Storage") and to access and re-download such Digital Books from Virtual Storage from time to time both during and after the term of this Agreement; (d) display and distribute (i) your trademarks and logos in the form you provide them to us or within Books (with such modifications as are necessary to optimize their viewing), and (ii) portions of Books, in each case solely for the purposes of marketing, soliciting and selling Books and related AfricanBooks.com offerings; (e) use, reproduce, adapt, modify, and distribute, as we determine appropriate, in our sole discretion, any metadata and product description, information or images that you make available in connection with Books; and (f) transmit, reproduce and otherwise use (or cause the reformatting, transmission, reproduction, and/or other use of) Books as mere technological incidents to and for the limited purpose of technically enabling the foregoing (e.g., caching to enable display). In addition, you agree that we may permit our affiliates and independent contractors, and our affiliates' independent contractors, to exercise the rights that you grant to us in this Agreement. "AfricanBooks.com Properties" means any web site, application or online point of presence, on any platform, that is owned or operated by or under license of AfricanBooks.com, and any web site, application, device or online point of presence through which any AfricanBooks.com Properties or products available for sale on them are syndicated, offered, merchandised, advertised or described. You grant us the rights set forth in this Section 5.5 on a worldwide basis; however, if we make available to you a procedure for indicating that you do not have worldwide distribution rights to a Digital Book, then the territory for the sale of that Digital Book will be those territories for which you indicate, through the procedure we provide to you, that you have distribution rights, except as otherwise provided in the Program Policies.
									<br><br>
									<b>5.6 DRM and Anti-Plagiarism Technology.</b> We may, but are not obligated, to provide you with the use of anti-theft, DRM technology in connection with the distribution of your Digital Books. If we do provide you with DRM technology, you acknowledge that we make no representations as to the efficacy of the DRM and will not be responsible for any failure of the DRM. We also may, but are not obligated, to use anti-plagiarism technology as a way of determining the originality of your Digital Books. It is in our discretion to refuse books for publishing if it is believed that it infringes on the copyright or intellectual property of another person.
									<br><br>
									<b>5.7 Rights Clearances and Rights Dispute Resolution.</b> You will obtain and pay for any and all necessary clearances and licenses for the Books to permit our exercise of the rights granted under this Agreement without any further payment obligation by us, including, without limitation, all royalties and other income due to any copyright owner. If you notify us through the procedure we provide on the applicable AfricanBooks.com Property for making claims of copyright infringement that a third party has made a Book available for distribution through the Program (or for distribution in a particular territory through the Program) that you have the exclusive right to make available under the Program, then, upon your request and after verification of your claim, we will pay you the Royalties due in connection with any sales of the Book through the Program, and will remove the Book from future sale through the Program, as your sole and exclusive remedy. 
									<br><br>
									<b>5.8 Representations, Warranties and Indemnities.</b> You represent and warrant that: 
									<br><br>

                                    <b>10.1 Disputes.</b> Any dispute or claim relating in any way to this Agreement or AfricanBooks.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, in accordance to all legal practices, laws and guidelines with the Republic of Uganda, in East Africa. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the law requirements of Uganda. AfricanBooks.com will not be responsible to reimburse any fees you incur to file arbitration or other legal claims. AfricanBooks.com will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person at a mutually agreed location. You and we each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and we each waive any right to a jury trial. You or we may bring suit in court on an individual basis only, and not in a class, consolidated or representative action, to apply for injunctive remedies. You may bring any such suit for injunctive remedies only in the courts of the Republic of Uganda, located in East Africa.
									<br><br>
									<b>10.2 Applicable Law.</b> The laws of the Republic of Uganda will govern this Agreement and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and AfricanBooks.com, represented by Leap Book Publishers Limited (U) relating to this Agreement or the Program. 
									<br><br>
									<b>10.3 Other Legal provisions.</b> This Agreement may not be amended, except in writing signed by both parties or as provided in Section 2 above. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid by a court or other tribunal with jurisdiction over the parties to this Agreement, that provision will be deemed to be restated to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties in accordance with applicable law, and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. Each party will bear its own costs and expenses in performing this Agreement. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of the party's rights to subsequently enforce the provision. Any AfricanBooks.com affiliate may join as a party to this Agreement and will notify you if it does. The joining AfricanBooks.com affiliate will be entitled to exercise the rights you grant under this Agreement. Each AfricanBooks.com party is severally liable for its own obligations under this Agreement and is not jointly liable for the obligations of other AfricanBooks.com parties. Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other, except that 
									<br><br>
									<b>(a)</b> AfricanBooks.com may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without consent and<br>
									<b>(b)</b> you may assign all of your rights and obligations under this Agreement to any corporation or other entity without consent in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of your assets, but you must give AfricanBooks.com written notice of the assignment no later than ten (10) business days following the assignment.
