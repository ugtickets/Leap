									AfricanBooks.com is committed to complying with all Ugandan laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage and use of personal information of Minors under the age of 13 as well as any applicable international laws that may apply, except as noted below: 
									<br><br>
									<b>(i)</b> our products and services are marketed for and directed towards purchase by adults or with the consent of adults;<br>
									<b>(ii)</b> Individuals under the age of 18 ("Minors") are not permitted to use AfricanBooks.com sites or Apps without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian;<br>

									If we direct certain platform features or Apps to Minors who may be under the age of 13, we require the parent or legal guardian to provide verifiable consent to such Minor’s use of our products and services and our collection of personal information in connection with such use. In these cases, we require validation of credit card information already on file with us and we will then e-mail the master account holder to give notice that we have received such consent. If no credit card information is on file, or if the credit card is invalid, we will not register that you have consented. With your consent, we may collect, use and share information regarding Minors under the age of 13 consistent with this Privacy Policy. Please see the sections above for detailed information on how we do so.
									<br><br>
									If you are a parent or guardian who believes that your Minor under the age of 13 has submitted personal information or other information to us without your consent, please contact us at: admin@AfricanBooks.com. Once we verify that you are the parent or legal guardian, at your request, we will promptly provide to you information regarding what, if any, personal information we have collected about your child and how it has been used or shared. We will, at your request, remove personal information about your child from our database and instruct our affiliates and third party partners to do the same.
